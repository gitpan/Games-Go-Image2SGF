=head1 NAME

Games::Go::Image2SGF -- interpret photographs of go positions.

=head1 SYNOPSIS

   my $board = Games::Go::Image2SGF->new(
       tl         => [50,   50],
       tr         => [1000, 50],
       bl         => [50,   1000],
       br         => [1000, 1000],
       image      => 'go_photograph.jpg'
   );

   $board->to_sgf;
   print $board->{sgf};

=head1 DESCRIPTION

B<Games::Go::Image2SGF> is a I<perl5> module to create a computer-readable I<SGF>
format description of a position on a Go board, given a photograph of the position.

=head1 OPTIONS

Options are passed to B<Games::Go::ImageSGF> via its constructor.  It will attempt
to use sane defaults for options you don't supply; keys must be supplied for the
required options. 

=over 4

=item tl, tr, bl, br

Required.  The coordinates of the four corners of the go board's grid.  You can obtain 
these by loading your photograph in an image editor that displays image coordinates
and hovering the cursor over each of the grid corners. 

=item white, black, board

Optional.  A fairly-representative colour for the white stones, black stones, 
and go board itself, presented in decimal RGB triplets -- eg. C<[255,255,255]> 
for white.  You should only set these if the generated SGF is incorrect.
Default:  Black is C<[0,0,0]>, white is C<[255,255,255]>, board colour is 
C<[100,100,100]>.

=item image 

Required.  The filename of the image to interpret.  This can be in any format 
supported by I<Imager>.

=item sample_radius

Optional.  After inferring the grid from the corner points you give, the module
will search in a radius of C<sample_radius> pixels to look for stones of a
particular colour.  As with C<white, black, board>:  the default is likely to
do the right thing, and you should only increase or decrease it if your image 
is very large or very small.
Default:  10 pixels.

=back

=head1 NOTES

You may want to use the methods defined in the module in another order, or
in conjunction with other methods of your own -- for example, to track
video of a live game instead of still images.  Note that methods with a 
leading C<_> are considered internal, and their semantics may change.

=head1 DEPENDENCIES

C<Imager>, C<perl5>.
